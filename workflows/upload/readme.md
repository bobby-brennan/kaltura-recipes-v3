# Upload a Video
This recipe will walk you through the process of uploading new videos using the Kaltura API. Video files can be located on disk, or be specified as an HTML file input. If you're working in a web environment, we highly recommend using the [jQuery Chunked File Upload Library](https://github.com/kaltura/chunked-file-upload-jquery). This library handles chunking files in Javascript, automatically determining the optimal chunk size and number of parallel uploaded chunks, as well as handle pause-and-resume and retry in case of temporary network failures. It completely abstracts and simplifies working with the [uploadToken](https://developer.kaltura.com/api-docs/#/uploadToken) service and file upload flow.,

## Uploading Files - Create an Upload Token
Use the uploadToken service to upload a new video file to the Kaltura API. First you'll need to use `uploadToken.add` to create a new upload token.

If you're working in JavaScript, the [jQuery File Upload widget](https://github.com/kaltura/jQuery-File-Upload) will take care of this step for you.

### API Call
```json
{
  "method": "get",
  "path": "/service/uploadtoken/action/add"
}
```
### Sample Code (javascript)
```javascript
$('input[name="fileData"]').fileupload({
      apiURL:'https://www.kaltura.com/api_v3/',
      url: 'https://www.kaltura.com/api_v3/?service=uploadToken&action=upload&format=1',
      ks: client.ks,
      singleFileUploads: true,
      dataType: 'json',
      autoUpload: true,
      submit: function(e, data) {
        console.log('uploading...')
      },
      done: function(e, data) {
        console.log('upload done.')
      },
});
```
### Sample Code (node)
```node
auto
```
### Sample Code (php)
```php
auto
```
### Sample Code (ruby)
```ruby
auto
```

## Uploading Files - Send the Data
Now we'll use the newly created Upload Token to upload a video file.
Or, if you're working in JavaScript, you can simply use the [jQuery File Upload widget](https://github.com/kaltura/jQuery-File-Upload)

If you don't have a video file handy, you can right-click [this link](http://cfvod.kaltura.com/pd/p/811441/sp/81144100/serveFlavor/entryId/1_2bjlk7qb/v/2/flavorId/1_d1ft34uv/fileName/Kaltura_Logo_Animation.flv/name/a.flv) and choose **Save As**.

### API Call
```json
{
  "method": "post",
  "path": "/service/uploadtoken/action/upload"
}
```
### Sample Code (javascript)
```javascript
$('input[name="fileData"]').fileupload({
      apiURL:'https://www.kaltura.com/api_v3/',
      url: 'https://www.kaltura.com/api_v3/?service=uploadToken&action=upload&format=1',
      ks: client.ks,
      singleFileUploads: true,
      dataType: 'json',
      autoUpload: true,
      submit: function(e, data) {
        console.log('uploading...')
      },
      done: function(e, data) {
        console.log('upload done.')
      },
});
```
### Sample Code (node)
```node
auto
```
### Sample Code (php)
```php
auto
```
### Sample Code (ruby)
```ruby
auto
```

## Creating a Media Entry
Now we'll create a Media Entry to hold our video. Use the form below to enter your video's details.

### API Call
```json
{
  "method": "get",
  "path": "/service/media/action/add"
}
```

### Demo
```html
disabled
```

## Attach the Video
Now that you've created a new Media Entry, you need to associate the uploaded video with it.

### API Call
```json
{
  "method": "post",
  "path": "/service/media/action/addContent"
}
```

## Viewing your Video
You can use kWidget to embed your video in HTML. The video may not be ready for a minute, so you can poll its status with `media.get` by hitting 'Send Request'.

### API Call
```json
{
  "method": "get",
  "path": "/service/media/action/get"
}
```
